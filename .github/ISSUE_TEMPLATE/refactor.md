## Refactor Request

### What part of the code needs refactoring?
<!-- Specify the module, function, or file that needs refactoring. -->

### Why should this be refactored?
<!-- Clearly explain the reason for refactoring. For example:
- Code is difficult to understand or maintain.
- Code violates best practices.
- There is significant duplication or inefficiency.
-->

### Expected Outcome
<!-- Describe the expected benefits of the refactor (e.g., better readability, performance improvements). -->

### Related Code or Files
<!-- Provide links to the relevant code or mention specific files. -->

### Additional Context
<!-- Add any other relevant information, examples, or links to discussions. -->

### Checklist
- [ ] I have searched for existing refactor requests.
- [ ] The refactor does **not** introduce new behavior changes.
- [ ] The reason for refactoring is clearly justified.
- [ ] I have provided references to the relevant code.
