# Contributing

We welcome contributions! Follow these guidelines to get started.

## Project and Goals

The Home Information app's goal is to create a people-focused way to organize the various information needed to manage their homes.  Home automation is great, but these systems tend to be device-focused instead of information-focused. They often add more complexity to your life rather than simplifying it.  By creating a "single pane of glass" for all the information related to your home, we can begin fulfilling the promise of automation and technology and make managing your home, and your life, simpler.

We've only just begun this journey. We've put some basic functionality in place to demonstrate its potential, but there are plenty of opportunities for improvements. Our [Road Map](https://github.com/users/cassandra/projects/1/views/3?visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C168603197%5D&sliceBy%5BcolumnId%5D=168603197) shows just some of the future features we are thinking about.

## How to Contribute

We are open to contributions from anyone.  There are a few different ways to contribute:
- **User** - Only requires installing and using the app.
- **Software Development** - For those wanting to get involved with writing code.
- **Graphic or UX Design** - For those with ideas on better visuals and/or better user experiences.

See the sections below for more details for each way to contribute.

### User Contributions

If you are simply interested in using the Home Information app, we would love for you to contribute your experiences and ideas for improving things.  Details for getting up and running are on the [Installation Page](docs/Installation.md).

Any and all feedback and ideas are welcome, such as:
- Features you would like to see.
- Improvements to existing features you would like.
- Integrations you could use.
- Good and bad usability issues.
- And bugs or glitches.

### Software Development Contributions

The following pages are for those wanting to contribute to the code base:

- [Development Page](docs/Development.md)
- [Development Setup Page](docs/dev/Setup.md)
- [Development Workflow Page](docs/dev/ContributorWorkflow.md)
- [Developer Documentation](docs/dev/README.md)

### Graphic and UX Design Contributions

As with many software projects like this, the UI and UX design tends to be done by software developers with only a passing sense of what "good" looks like and/or are too busy trying to make everything actually work to have time to devote to refining the UI/UX.  If you tend toward thinking and caring about the visual style and user experience, it would greatly complement the team.

We are not currently set up with a workflow for contributing in this manner, but all we need are some people with the interest and we'll develop something.  Just let us know if this sounds like something you are interested in.
