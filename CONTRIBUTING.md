# Contributing to Home Information

We welcome all kinds of contributions! Whether you want to use the software and share feedback, improve the code, or help with design and documentation, there's a place for you in this project.

## Quick Start for New Contributors

**Want to jump in quickly?** Here's the fastest path to making your first contribution:

### 1. Try the Software (5-10 minutes)
- Follow the [Installation Guide](docs/Installation.md) to get it running
- Spend 15-30 minutes exploring the interface
- Note what works well and what could be improved

### 2. Join the Community (2 minutes)  
- Star the repository on GitHub
- Watch the repository for updates on issues and discussions
- Check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/cassandra/projects/1/views/3?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Todo&sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=asc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=168748500&visibleFields=%5B%22Title%22%2C168748500%2C%22Assignees%22%2C168599747%2C168599748%2C168599745%2C168599746%2C168599744%2C168603197%5D) to see where we're heading

### 3. Make Your First Contribution
Choose what appeals to you:
- **Easy:** Submit feedback or bug reports about your user experience
- **Medium:** Improve documentation based on your setup experience  
- **Advanced:** Pick up a "good first issue" from the GitHub issues

No contribution is too small! Even fixing typos or clarifying confusing documentation helps the project.

## Ways to Contribute

### üè† User Contributions
*The foundation of open source - real users with real needs*

**What we need:**
- Test the software in real home environments
- Report bugs and usability issues
- Request features that would solve actual problems  
- Share how you're using Home Information

**Why it matters:** Software built without real user feedback often solves the wrong problems. Your experience using the software in your actual home is incredibly valuable.

**Getting started:**
1. Install and set up Home Information for your home
2. Use it for at least a week to organize some real information
3. Document what works, what doesn't, and what's missing
4. Create GitHub issues with your feedback

### Software Development
*For those who want to build the future of home information management*

**What we need:**
- Bug fixes and performance improvements
- New features and integrations  
- Code quality improvements and refactoring
- Testing and CI/CD improvements

**Tech stack:**
- **Backend:** Django 4.2, Python 3.11+
- **Frontend:** JavaScript (jQuery), Bootstrap 4, HTML/CSS
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Redis

**Getting started:**
1. Check [Development Setup](docs/Development.md) for environment setup
2. Browse "good first issue" labels in GitHub issues
3. Read the [architecture overview](docs/dev/shared/architecture-overview.md) and [Data Model](docs/dev/shared/data-model.md) documents
4. Start with small improvements to get familiar with the codebase

**Development workflow:**
- Fork the repository
- Create feature branches for your changes
- Follow the testing and code quality guidelines  
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions
- Participate in code review discussions

### Design & User Experience
*Make home technology actually usable and beautiful*

**What we need:**
- User interface improvements and consistency
- User experience research and recommendations
- Visual design and iconography
- Mobile and responsive design improvements
- Accessibility improvements

**Why it matters:** Great home management software needs great design. Most home automation focuses on making things work; we want to make them work well for real people.

**Getting started:**
1. Use the software and document usability issues
2. Create mockups or wireframes for improvements
3. Suggest design patterns that would improve workflows
4. Contribute CSS/HTML improvements

We don't have a formal design workflow yet, but we're eager to work with anyone interested in improving the user experience.

## Project Vision & Goals

Understanding our goals will help you contribute more effectively:

### Core Philosophy
**People-centered home technology.** We believe home technology should adapt to how people think about their homes, not force people to adapt to how engineers organize code.

**Integration over replacement.** Work with existing investments in home automation and security rather than forcing people to start over.

**Local-first, privacy-focused.** Your home information stays in your home, under your control.

### What We're Building
- A spatial, visual interface for home information management
- Integration platform for home automation, security, and monitoring systems  
- A bridge between device-centric automation and information-centric home management

### What Success Looks Like
- Homeowners can find any piece of home information in under 30 seconds
- Setting up new smart devices includes organizing their information, not just connecting them
- Complex homes become easier to manage, not harder
