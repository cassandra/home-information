# Django View Test Refactoring Plan: Eliminating Over-Mocking

## Overview

This document provides a detailed action plan for refactoring Django view tests to eliminate over-mocking violations that contradict our testing philosophy. The goal is to replace unnecessary mocks with real objects and focus on testing actual behavior rather than implementation details.

## Testing Philosophy Reference

**Key Guidelines (from docs/dev/Testing.md):**
- Mock at system boundaries only (HTTP calls, external services)
- Use real database operations instead of mocking Django ORM
- Don't mock internal Django components (forms, models, managers)
- Test actual behavior and return values, not mock call parameters
- Default should be to use real objects - only mock when there's a clear reason

**Anti-Patterns to Eliminate:**
- Mocking Django forms when real validation should be tested
- Mocking internal application managers when real objects would work
- Testing mock call verification instead of actual behavior
- Over-mocking internal components that breaks integration

## Priority Categories

### 🔴 **CRITICAL PRIORITY** - Django Form Over-Mocking
Major violations of testing philosophy requiring immediate attention.

### 🟡 **HIGH PRIORITY** - Internal Manager Over-Mocking  
Significant violations that break integration testing.

### 🟢 **MEDIUM PRIORITY** - Mock Call Verification Issues
Tests that focus on mocks instead of behavior.

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL PRIORITY: Django Form Over-Mocking

**Status: COMPLETED** ✅

All critical Django form over-mocking issues have been addressed. The remaining work involves manager over-mocking patterns which are categorized as High Priority.

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY: Internal Manager Over-Mocking

These tests mock internal application components when real objects with test data would provide better integration testing.

### 1. Collection Position Edit Tests - **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** 🟡
**File:** `src/hi/apps/collection/edit/tests/test_views.py`
**Status:** Mocks removed, setup improved, but tests still failing with 500 errors
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours (debugging remaining issues)

#### Current Status:
**COMPLETED:**
- ✅ Removed `@patch.object(LocationManager, 'get_default_location')` mocking
- ✅ Removed `@patch('hi.apps.collection.edit.forms.CollectionPositionForm')` mocking  
- ✅ Added proper test setup with Location and LocationView creation
- ✅ Added `order_id=1` to Location for `get_default_location()` to find it
- ✅ Created LocationView and set session context with `setSessionLocationView()`

**REMAINING ISSUES:**
- Tests still return 500 errors despite proper setup
- May need additional debugging of view dependencies
- Real objects are created correctly but view execution fails

**Implementation Notes for Future Sessions:**
- CollectionPosition uses `svg_x`, `svg_y` fields (not `x`, `y`)
- LocationManager requires Location with proper `order_id` or session `location_view_id`
- Form expects `svg_position_bounds` from Location model
- Consider simplifying test or investigating view middleware dependencies

### 2. Entity Status Display Tests - **COMPLETED** ✅
**File:** `src/hi/apps/entity/tests/test_views.py`

**Refactored Tests:**
- ✅ `test_get_status_with_data_sync` - Removed StatusDisplayManager mocking
- ✅ `test_get_status_with_data_async` - Removed StatusDisplayManager mocking
- ✅ `test_entity_with_no_status_data_shows_edit_interface` - Removed StatusDisplayManager mocking

**Key Improvements Achieved:**
- Eliminated mocking of `StatusDisplayManager`
- Tests now use real Entity and EntityState objects  
- Real StatusDisplayManager processes real data and returns appropriate responses
- Tests verify actual context data and behavior delegation
- All tests pass with real business logic

### 3. Security Manager Tests - **COMPLETED** ✅
**File:** `src/hi/apps/security/tests/test_views.py`

**Refactored Tests:**
- ✅ `test_valid_security_action_arm` - Removed SecurityManager mocking
- ✅ `test_valid_security_action_disable` - Removed SecurityManager mocking  
- ✅ `test_valid_security_action_set_day` - Removed SecurityManager mocking
- ✅ `test_security_status_in_context` - Removed SecurityManager mocking
- ✅ `test_multiple_action_types` - Removed SecurityManager mocking

**Key Improvements Achieved:**
- Eliminated mocking of `SecurityManager`
- Tests now use real SecurityManager singleton with `SecurityManager._instance = None` reset
- Real security state changes and status data processing
- All security actions (SET_AWAY, DISABLE, SET_DAY, SET_NIGHT, SNOOZE) tested with real objects
- All tests pass with real security business logic

### 4. Weather Manager Tests - **COMPLETED** ✅
**File:** `src/hi/apps/weather/tests/test_views.py`

**Refactored Tests:**
- ✅ `test_get_forecast_sync` - Removed WeatherManager mocking
- ✅ `test_get_forecast_async` - Removed WeatherManager mocking
- ✅ `test_forecast_context_data` - Removed WeatherManager mocking

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Mock Call Verification Issues

These tests focus on verifying mock calls instead of testing actual behavior.

### 5. Manager Method Call Verification
**Various Files**
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour per file

#### Pattern to Fix:
```python
# BAD - Testing mock calls
mock_manager.some_method.assert_called_once_with(expected_params)

# GOOD - Testing actual side effects
result = real_manager.some_method(params)
self.assertEqual(actual_database_state, expected_state)
```

#### Files with this pattern:
- Entity edit tests with `EntityManager.add_entity_to_view` calls
- Event edit tests with event manager method calls
- Various manager method call verifications

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting Each Session:

1. **Read the test file** to understand current test structure
2. **Review the view being tested** to understand its functionality
3. **Check the forms and models** involved to understand validation rules
4. **Look at existing good test examples** in `hi/apps/user/tests/test_views.py` or `hi/apps/api/tests/test_views.py`

### Refactoring Process:

1. **Identify all mocks** in the test method
2. **Determine which are system boundaries** (external APIs, email) vs internal components
3. **Replace internal mocks** with real objects and test data
4. **Change assertions** from mock call verification to behavior verification
5. **Test database state changes** instead of mock interactions
6. **Verify the test still covers the same functionality** but with real integration

### Testing Commands:

```bash
# Run specific test file
cd src && ./manage.py test hi.apps.event.edit.tests.test_views

# Run specific test method  
cd src && ./manage.py test hi.apps.event.edit.tests.test_views.TestEventDefinitionEditView.test_get_event_definition_edit

# Run all tests to ensure no regressions
cd src && ./manage.py test

# Check code quality
cd src && flake8 --config=.flake8-ci src/
```

### Success Criteria:

- [ ] No mocking of Django forms, models, or internal managers
- [ ] Tests focus on actual behavior and database state changes
- [ ] Real form validation is tested with real data
- [ ] Integration between components is preserved
- [ ] All tests continue to pass
- [ ] Code coverage is maintained or improved

## Session Planning

### Recommended Session Order (Updated):

1. ✅ **Session 1:** Event definition edit tests (Critical - most complex) - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ **Session 2:** Entity edit tests (Critical - moderate complexity) - **KEY TESTS COMPLETED**  
3. ✅ **Session 3:** Location edit tests (Critical - simpler) - **KEY TESTS COMPLETED**
4. ✅ **Session 4:** Collection edit tests (Critical - form mocking) - **CRITICAL FORMS COMPLETED**
5. ✅ **Session 5:** Entity status display tests (High priority) - **COMPLETED**
6. ✅ **Session 6:** Security manager tests (High priority) - **COMPLETED**

8. 🟡 **Session 8:** Collection position tests (High priority - debugging) - **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
9. **Session 9:** Mock call verification cleanup (Medium priority)

### Time Estimates (Updated):
- **Total Original Effort:** 15-20 hours across 7-8 sessions
- **Completed Work:** ~16-18 hours (Event, Entity, Location, Collection form refactoring + Entity Status, Security, Weather manager refactoring)
- **Remaining Effort:** ~2-3 hours across 2 sessions
- **Next Priority Session:** Collection position tests debugging (1-2 hours) or Mock call verification cleanup (1-2 hours)

### Established Refactoring Patterns:

From the completed work, future sessions should follow these established patterns:

1. **Form Refactoring Pattern:**
   - Remove all `@patch('app.forms.FormClass')` decorators
   - Create real form data dictionaries with proper field values
   - Test actual form validation errors with invalid data
   - Verify real database changes instead of mock calls

2. **JSON Redirect Pattern:**
   - Expect `antinode.redirect_response()` to return JSON: `{"location": "/redirect/url"}`
   - Use `self.assertJsonResponse(response)` and `response.json()['location']`
   - NOT traditional 302 redirects

3. **Manager Integration Pattern:**
   - Remove manager mocking when testing internal business logic
   - Let real managers process real test data
   - Verify database state changes (Entity creation, relationships, etc.)
   - Only mock external service boundaries

4. **Formset Testing Pattern:**
   - Include comprehensive formset data with proper prefixes
   - Test `TOTAL_FORMS`, `INITIAL_FORMS`, management form fields
   - Verify formset validation errors and successful saves
   - Check related model creation (EventClause, AlarmAction, etc.)

5. **Enum Value Testing Pattern:**
   - Use valid lowercase enum values in test data (e.g., `'appliances'` not `'APPLIANCES'`)
   - Include all required form fields (e.g., `order_id` for Collection forms)
   - Test form field initialization (e.g., `form.fields['include_in_location_view'].initial`)
   - Verify database state with proper enum values

6. **Singleton Manager Refactoring Pattern:**
   - Remove `@patch.object(ManagerClass, '__new__')` and similar manager mocking
   - Add `setUp()` method with `ManagerClass._instance = None` to reset singleton state
   - Let real managers process real test data instead of mocked responses
   - Test actual context data and business logic responses (may be empty if no data)
   - Focus on integration behavior rather than mock call verification
   - Examples: StatusDisplayManager, SecurityManager, WeatherManager successfully refactored

## Context for Future Sessions

### Key Files and Their Roles:

- **View Test Base:** `hi/tests/view_test_base.py` - Provides testing infrastructure
- **Testing Guidelines:** `docs/dev/Testing.md` - Complete testing philosophy
- **Forms:** Located in each app's `forms.py` - Define validation rules
- **Managers:** Located in each app's `*_manager.py` - Business logic layer
- **Models:** Located in each app's `models.py` - Database schema

### Good Test Examples to Reference:

- `hi/apps/user/tests/test_views.py` - Proper external service mocking
- `hi/apps/api/tests/test_views.py` - Real HTTP response testing  
- `hi/apps/notify/tests/test_views.py` - Real database operations

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:

- `@patch('django.forms.Form')` or similar Django component mocking
- `mock_form.is_valid.return_value = True` - test real validation
- `mock_manager.method.assert_called_once()` - test actual side effects
- Extensive mock setup that's more complex than real data setup
