# Features

Home Information provides comprehensive tools for organizing, monitoring, and controlling all aspects of your home. Features are organized by the value they provide to you as a homeowner.

## Information Management & Organization

**What it does:** Store, organize, and access all your home-related documents, notes, and data using a visual, location-based approach.

### Spatial Data Organization
- **Position items visually** on floor plans or property maps
- **Multiple location support** - separate views for different floors, attic, basement, or outdoor areas
- **Custom background images** - upload floor plans, property surveys, or photos of your actual spaces
- **Flexible item types** - individual items (appliances, fixtures), areas (pool, garden), or linear features (electrical lines, plumbing)

**Real-world benefit:** Instead of searching through folders for "kitchen appliance info," you click on your kitchen and see all relevant information right where you'd expect it.

### Document & Information Storage
- **Upload any file type** - manuals, warranties, photos, receipts, inspection reports
- **Rich text notes** - maintenance logs, specifications, installation notes
- **Attribute system** - structured data like model numbers, purchase dates, service providers
- **Full search** across all stored information (future)

**Use case example:** Your dishwasher starts making noise. Click on it to instantly see the manual, warranty info, installation date, and service history - everything you need to decide whether to call for service or attempt a repair.

### Multi-View Organization
- **Location Views** - different perspectives of the same physical space (All Items, Kitchen Focus, Security Zones)
- **Collections** - organize portable items like tools, small appliances, or seasonal decorations
- **Zoom and focus** - save specific view settings for easy navigation to areas of interest

**Perfect for:** Managing complex properties where a single view becomes cluttered, or focusing on specific systems (like showing only HVAC-related items).

## Home Automation & Device Control

**What it does:** Integrate with existing home automation systems to provide device control within the spatial context of your home.

### Home Assistant Integration
- **Device control** - lights, switches, sensors, and other Home Assistant-managed devices
- **Status monitoring** - real-time device states displayed visually on your home layout
- **Historical data** - device state change histories and usage patterns
- **Automated rules** - create event triggers and automation rules

**Real-world benefit:** Instead of opening a separate app and navigating device lists, you see device status right on your home map and control them in context.

### Event & Automation System
- **Visual rule builder** - create automation rules using the spatial interface
- **Cross-system integration** - rules can involve devices from different platforms
- **Event history** - track what happened when across all your systems

**Use case example:** Set up a rule where motion detected in the driveway (security system) automatically turns on the porch light (home automation) and sends you an alert with the camera view.

### Weather & Environmental Data
- **Local weather integration** - current conditions and forecasts using your exact coordinates
- **Astronomical data** - sunrise/sunset, moon phases for outdoor lighting and security planning
- **Integration with local sensors** - if you have weather stations or environmental monitoring

## Security & Monitoring

**What it does:** Unify security monitoring, alerts, and camera management within your home's spatial context.

### Visual Security Management
- **Security zone visualization** - see armed/disarmed status using color-coded zones on your home layout
- **Multi-mode support** - different security profiles (Home, Away, Sleep) with different zone configurations
- **Historical security data** - track arm/disarm events, sensor triggers, and security system activity

**Real-world benefit:** At a glance, see which areas of your home are secured and quickly identify any issues without navigating through security system menus.

### ZoneMinder Camera Integration
- **Camera positioning** - place camera icons exactly where cameras are located and define the areas they cover
- **Live stream access** - click on camera icons to view live feeds
- **Event browsing** - review motion detection events and recordings
- **Auto-viewing** - automatically display relevant camera feeds when alarms trigger

**Use case example:** Motion sensor triggers in the backyard. The system automatically shows you the backyard camera feed while logging the event and can send email alerts with relevant information.

### Alert & Notification System
- **Visual alerts** - on-screen notifications with color-coded severity
- **Audio alerts** - customizable sounds for different event types
- **Email notifications** - stay informed when away from home
- **Smart filtering** - avoid alert fatigue with intelligent event prioritization

### Advanced Security Features
- **Event correlation** - connect security events across different systems (motion + camera + lights)
- **Alarm history** - comprehensive logging and analysis of security events
- **Customize security modes** - define your own security profiles for Home/Away/Sleep

## User Interface & Experience

**What it does:** Provide intuitive, efficient ways to interact with all your home information and systems.

### Visual Navigation
- **Spatial interface** - navigate by clicking on areas of your home
- **Zoom controls** - focus on specific areas or see the big picture
- **Multiple view modes** - switch between different perspectives of your home
- **Touch-friendly** - works well on tablets and touch displays

### Screen Management
- **Sleep mode** - dim the interface for always-on displays without disrupting functionality
- **Screen lock** - temporary password protection for when visitors are present
- **Sound controls** - mute/unmute alerts and system sounds
- **Always-on friendly** - designed for dedicated home displays

### Editing & Administration
- **Visual editing mode** - drag and drop items, resize, and reshape areas
- **Bulk operations** - efficiently manage multiple items or data imports
- **User management** - multiple user accounts with different access levels (optional)
- **Backup & restore** - keeps history of all information changes and one-click restoring

**Perfect for:** Households that want a dedicated home management display, or anyone who prefers visual organization over list-based interfaces.

## Integration & Extensibility

**What it does:** Work with your existing home technology investments and provide a platform for future expansion.

### Current Integrations
- **Home Assistant** - Complete integration with the popular open-source home automation platform
- **ZoneMinder** - Full-featured security camera management
- **Weather APIs** - National Weather Service and OpenMeteo for local conditions

### Integration Architecture
- **API-based** - clean interfaces for adding new integrations
- **Local-first** - integrations work within your network, no cloud dependencies required
- **Modular design** - enable only the integrations you need

### Data Management
- **Local storage** - all data stays on your devices using SQLite
- **File management** - uploaded documents stored in organized directory structure
- **Export capabilities** - protect your data investment with export options
- **Privacy by design** - no external data sharing unless you explicitly configure it

**Future-ready:** The platform is designed to accommodate new integrations as your needs evolve or new home technologies emerge.

## Getting Started Benefits

**Day 1 Value:** Even before setting up any integrations, you can start organizing your home information and see immediate benefits from having everything in one visual interface.

**Progressive Enhancement:** Start simple with just information management, then add device integration and monitoring as you have time and interest.

**Flexible Implementation:** Works equally well for simple documentation needs or complex multi-system integration scenarios.

**Investment Protection:** Integrates with existing systems rather than requiring you to replace working technology.
