# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Workflow for GitHub Issues

When working on GitHub issues, follow this development workflow:

1. **Read the GitHub issue and all its comments** - Understand the requirements, context, and any discussion

2. **Ensure you're on the latest staging branch** - MANDATORY step before any work:
   - Switch to staging branch: `git checkout staging`
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin staging`
   - Verify you're on the correct branch: `git status`

3. **Investigate and plan the implementation** - MANDATORY step for all issues:
   - Assign the issue to yourself: `gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-assignee @me`
   - Research the codebase to understand current implementation  
   - Identify files, functions, and components that need changes
   - Consider edge cases, dependencies, and potential impacts
   - Plan the implementation approach and sequence of changes
   - **Post a comment on the GitHub issue** documenting:
     - Summary of investigation findings
     - Proposed implementation approach
     - Key files/components that will be modified
     - Any questions or concerns identified
   - **Wait for confirmation only if**:
     - You have critical questions that could affect the implementation
     - Important information is missing or unclear from the issue
     - Multiple solution approaches exist with no clear best choice
     - The proposed changes have significant architectural implications
   - Otherwise, proceed directly to implementation

4. **Initialize development environment** - MANDATORY before any development work:
   - Run environment setup: `. ./init-env-dev.sh`
   - This sets up the virtual environment and all necessary environment variables

5. **Create a dev branch off the staging branch** - Use proper naming convention:
   - **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/##-description` (e.g., `bugfix/31-controller-modal-fix`)
   - **New features**: `feature/##-description` (e.g., `feature/45-weather-alerts`)
   - **Documentation**: `docs/##-description` (e.g., `docs/22-api-documentation`)
   - **Operations**: `ops/##-description` (e.g., `ops/18-docker-improvements`)
   - **Refactoring**: `refactor/##-description` (e.g., `refactor/33-cleanup-views`)
   - See `docs/dev/Workflow.md` for complete conventions including test-only and tweak branches
6. **Do development changes** - Commit to git at logical checkpoints during development
7. **After first commit, push the branch to GitHub** - Use the same branch name as the local one
8. **Once issue is complete and all changes pushed** - Create a pull request using the template
9. **Before creating the pull request** - Run full test validation (see Testing Workflow below)

### Testing Workflow (Required Before Pull Requests)

**MANDATORY**: Before creating any pull request, you must run and pass all of these checks:

**NOTE**: All commands run from PROJECT ROOT directory for consistency.

```bash
# First ensure environment is initialized (if not already done in step 4)
. ./init-env-dev.sh

# 1. Run full unit test suite
src/manage.py test
# Must show: "OK" with all tests passing

# 2. Run code quality check (only if source code was modified)
flake8 --config=src/.flake8-ci src/hi/
# Must show: no output (clean)

# 3. Verify Django configuration
src/manage.py check
# Must show: "System check identified no issues"
```

**Important**: Do not create pull requests if any of these checks fail. Fix all issues first.

### Pull Request Requirements

Before any pull request can be merged, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Unit Tests**: All unit tests must pass (`src/manage.py test`)
2. **Code Quality**: flake8 linting with `.flake8-ci` configuration must pass with no violations (if source code modified) (`flake8 --config=src/.flake8-ci src/hi/`)
3. **Django Check**: Django system check must pass with no issues (`src/manage.py check`)
4. **GitHub CI**: GitHub Actions will automatically verify these requirements and will block PR merging if they fail

These requirements are enforced by GitHub branch protection rules and cannot be bypassed.

For detailed branching conventions and additional workflow information, see `docs/dev/Workflow.md`.

### Work Documentation for Non-Trivial Issues

When working on complex issues that involve significant planning or multi-step implementation:

1. **Capture Work Progress**: Document completed work, current status, and remaining tasks
2. **Document Planning**: Record architectural decisions, implementation approaches, and design rationale
3. **Maintain Context**: Keep notes that allow resuming work efficiently if interrupted
4. **Reference in Issues**: Update the GitHub issue with progress summaries and decision points

This documentation helps maintain continuity across work sessions and provides valuable context for code reviews and future maintenance.

## Environment-Specific Configuration

### Git Remote Configuration
- Use `git push origin` or `git push -u origin branch-name` for pushing branches

### Development Commands Quick Reference
For detailed setup and daily commands, see [Development Setup](dev/Setup.md).

```bash
# Daily development setup
. ./init-env-dev.sh

# Common commands (all run from PROJECT ROOT)
src/manage.py test
flake8 --config=src/.flake8-ci src/hi/
src/manage.py runserver  # http://127.0.0.1:8411
```

## Project Documentation References

For comprehensive project information, see:

- **Architecture**: [dev/Architecture.md](dev/Architecture.md) - System design, patterns, and component overview
- **Development Guidelines**: [dev/Guidelines.md](dev/Guidelines.md) - Coding standards, style guide, and conventions
- **Testing**: [dev/Testing.md](dev/Testing.md) - Testing patterns, best practices, and anti-patterns
- **Setup**: [dev/Setup.md](dev/Setup.md) - Environment setup and daily development commands
- **Workflow**: [dev/Workflow.md](dev/Workflow.md) - Branching, commits, and pull request process

## Release Process (Claude-Specific)

When executing the release process documented in `docs/dev/ReleaseProcesses.md`, use these AI-specific commands and considerations:

### Release Execution Commands
```bash
# Pre-release verification (combine all checks)
git status && make check

# Version bump and commit
git add HI_VERSION && git commit -m "Bump version number to vX.X.X"
git push origin staging

# Merge to master
git checkout master && git pull origin master
git merge staging && git push origin master

# Create release (CLI method - preferred for automation)
gh release create vX.X.X --title "vX.X.X" --generate-notes --latest
```

### Release Process Considerations
- **Working Directory**: Always verify clean working directory before starting
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: GitHub may warn about dependencies during push - note but don't block release
- **Documentation Changes**: Commit any documentation updates to staging before switching branches
- **GitHub CLI**: Prefer `gh` command for release creation over manual UI steps

See `docs/dev/ReleaseProcesses.md` for the complete process documentation.

## Generated Code Standards (Claude-Specific)

All generated code must comply with the `.flake8-ci` configuration rules. Common issues to avoid:

1. **Final Newlines**: All files must end with a single newline character
2. **Unused Imports**: Remove all unused import statements
3. **Unused Variables**: Remove or prefix unused variables with underscore (`_variable`)
4. **Line Continuation**: Proper indentation for multi-line statements following PEP 8
5. **Line Length**: Respect maximum line length limits defined in `.flake8-ci`

Before submitting code, always run: `flake8 --config=src/.flake8-ci src/hi/` to verify compliance.

## Commit Message Guidelines (Claude-Specific)

- Use concise, descriptive commit messages without attribution text
- Focus on **what** was changed and **why**, not implementation details
- Keep messages professional and project-focused
- **Do NOT include** Claude Code attribution, co-author tags, or generated-by comments

**Good examples:**
```
Fix weather module unit test failures and improve WMO units handling
Add support for temperature offset unit arithmetic in Pint
Remove invalid AlertUrgency.PAST enum value for weather alerts
```

**Avoid:**
```
