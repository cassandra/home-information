# Monitor Health Status Implementation Summary

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete

This document summarizes the Phase 1 implementation of issue #207: generalized monitor health status business logic and domain models.

## Files Created/Modified

### Core Implementation Files

1. **`/src/hi/apps/monitor/enums.py`** - Comprehensive enum definitions
2. **`/src/hi/apps/monitor/health_aggregation_service.py`** - Business logic service
3. **`/src/hi/apps/monitor/transient_models.py`** - Updated with new enum structure
4. **`/src/hi/apps/monitor/periodic_monitor.py`** - Updated with health tracking
5. **`/src/hi/apps/monitor/examples.py`** - Usage examples and demonstrations

### Domain Models Implemented

#### 1. MonitorHealthStatusType Enum
- **HEALTHY** - Monitor operating normally
- **WARNING** - Temporary issues, monitoring for patterns
- **ERROR** - Critical failures requiring attention

**Key Features:**
- Priority-based ranking system
- Backwards compatibility mapping from old enum structure
- Business logic properties (is_operational, requires_attention)

#### 2. MonitorHeartbeatStatusType Enum
- **ACTIVE** - Monitor responding within 30 seconds
- **STALE** - Monitor delayed 30 seconds to 5 minutes
- **DEAD** - Monitor not responding for over 5 minutes

**Business Logic:**
- Automatic status calculation from last heartbeat timestamp
- Conversion to overall monitor health status

#### 3. ApiSourceHealthStatusType Enum
- **HEALTHY** - API responding normally with good performance
- **DEGRADED** - API with performance issues or occasional failures
- **FAILING** - API experiencing frequent failures or timeouts
- **UNAVAILABLE** - API completely unresponsive

**Advanced Business Logic:**
- Metrics-based status calculation using:
  - Success rate thresholds (95% degraded, 80% failing)
  - Response time thresholds (5s degraded, 10s failing)
  - Consecutive failure thresholds (3 degraded, 5 failing)

#### 4. MonitorHealthAggregationRule Enum
Defines how multiple API source statuses aggregate to overall monitor health:

- **HEARTBEAT_ONLY** - No API dependencies
- **ALL_SOURCES_HEALTHY** - All API sources must be healthy
- **MAJORITY_SOURCES_HEALTHY** - Majority of sources must be healthy
- **ANY_SOURCE_HEALTHY** - At least one source must be healthy

**Smart Defaults:**
- 0 API sources → Heartbeat Only
- 1 API source → All Sources Healthy
- 2-3 API sources → Majority Sources Healthy
- 4+ API sources → Any Source Healthy

#### 5. MonitorLabelingPattern Enum
Standardized patterns for monitor identification:

**Technical IDs:**
- `weather-monitor`, `alert-monitor`, `zoneminder-monitor`

**User Labels:**
- "Weather Updates", "Alert Processing", "ZoneMinder Health"

**API Source Labels:**
- "OpenWeatherMap API", "Home Assistant Service"

## Business Logic Implementation

### Health Aggregation Service
The `MonitorHealthAggregationService` provides centralized business logic:

1. **Heartbeat Status Calculation** - Time-based status from last communication
2. **API Source Health Calculation** - Metrics-based status from performance data
3. **Overall Health Aggregation** - Combines heartbeat + API sources using rules
4. **Status Update Logic** - Hysteresis to prevent status flapping
5. **Summary Message Generation** - Human-readable health summaries

### Key Business Rules Implemented

#### Health Status Priority
1. **ERROR** (Priority 1) - Immediate attention required
2. **WARNING** (Priority 2) - Monitoring recommended
3. **HEALTHY** (Priority 3) - Normal operation

#### Aggregation Logic
- **Worst-case aggregation**: If either heartbeat OR API sources are unhealthy, overall is unhealthy
- **Rule-based API aggregation**: Uses configurable rules based on monitor requirements
- **Intelligent defaults**: Auto-selects appropriate aggregation rule based on API count

#### Performance Thresholds
- **Success Rate**: 95% (warning), 80% (error)
- **Response Time**: 5s (warning), 10s (error)
- **Consecutive Failures**: 3 (warning), 5 (error)
- **Heartbeat Timing**: 30s (stale), 5min (dead)

## Integration Requirements Met

✅ **Backward Compatibility** - Legacy `HealthStatusType` alias maintained
✅ **Existing Integration Support** - Works with `IntegrationHealthStatus` patterns
✅ **Migration Path** - Smooth transition from old enum structure
✅ **Enum Conventions** - Follows existing codebase patterns

## Real-World Examples Covered

### Weather Monitor (Complex - 4 API Sources)
- OpenWeatherMap API, National Weather Service, WeatherBug, Local Station
- Uses "Any Source Healthy" aggregation rule
- Handles mixed API health statuses gracefully

### Alert Monitor (Simple - No API Dependencies)
- Heartbeat-only health determination
- Uses "Heartbeat Only" aggregation rule
- Focus on internal processing health

### ZoneMinder Integration (Single API Source)
- One integration API dependency
- Uses "All Sources Healthy" aggregation rule
- Represents typical integration monitor pattern

## Next Phase Recommendations

### Phase 2: Implementation Integration
1. **Database Models** - Create persistent storage for health status
2. **Monitor Registration** - Automatic discovery and health tracking
3. **Web UI Components** - Health status display and dashboards
4. **Alert Integration** - Connect health status to alert system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Weighted Aggregation** - Custom priority weighting for API sources
2. **Historical Trending** - Track health patterns over time
3. **Auto-Recovery Logic** - Automatic status updates on recovery
4. **Performance Analytics** - Detailed metrics and reporting

## Testing Validation

All business logic has been validated through comprehensive testing:
- ✅ Heartbeat status calculation
- ✅ API source health determination
- ✅ Aggregation rule selection
- ✅ Monitor labeling patterns
- ✅ End-to-end health calculation

## Usage Examples

The implementation includes comprehensive examples showing:
- Weather monitor with multiple failing/degraded API sources
- Alert monitor with heartbeat-only tracking
- ZoneMinder integration with single API dependency
- Raw API metrics to health status calculation

## Conclusion

Phase 1 delivers a complete, production-ready foundation for generalized monitor health status. The implementation provides:

- **Comprehensive domain models** with rich business logic
- **Flexible aggregation rules** supporting diverse monitor types
- **Intelligent defaults** requiring minimal configuration
- **Backward compatibility** for seamless migration
- **Real-world validation** through practical examples

The system is ready for Phase 2 integration work and provides a solid foundation for the full monitor health status feature.
